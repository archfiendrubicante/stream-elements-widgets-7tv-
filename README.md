# StreamElements Widgets by Zaytri
Hi! Feel free to check out the code of my various custom stream widgets.

## Widget List
- [Animated Gradient Frame](AnimatedGradientFrame)
- [Chat Leaderboard](LevelUp)
- [Dynamic Chat Bubbles](DynamicChatBubbles)

You can see all of them in action on my Twitch! https://www.twitch.tv/zaytri

This is a fork of the main branch that re-enables 7tv emotes.
Pepes are not some kind of racist icon, get off your high horse.
